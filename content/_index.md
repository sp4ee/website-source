![Sketch of the Solarpunk Forever Engine](/images/sp4ee-concept-sketch.jpg#narrow)

The Solarpunk Forever_Engine (or SP4EE) will be a tiny scratch-built solar engine. It will spin when the sun shines and it will keep counting its turns forever. It's a silly idea with no practical use, which is why I like it. There's more [about the concept here](/about).

Building SP4EE is my first attempt to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). I barely know a thing about electronics, microcontrollers or motors. So this will be a lot of fun!
