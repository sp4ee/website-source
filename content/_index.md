The Solarpunk Forever_Engine (or SP4EE) will be a tiny scratch-built solar engine. It will spin when the sun shines and it will keep counting its turns forever. It's a silly idea with no practical use, which is why I like it. There's more [about the concept here](/about).

I am building SP4EE as a public learning experiment. I have minimal experience with electronics, microcontrollers or motors. So this is guaranteed to be a lot of fun!
