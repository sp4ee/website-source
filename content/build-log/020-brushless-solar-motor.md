Learning about pummers awakened my building instinct, but it turns out the desire goes much deeper this time. A blinking light is, well, a blinking light, but it's somehow very -- abstract? immaterial? The non-sitters in the BEAM taxonomy get their twitchy motion from tiny motors soldered in weird ways, and that, in turn, is somehow a little -- scrappy?

I want motion, but also elegance, and at least a semblance of technical bravado. And hey, my whole obsession with making started with microcontrollers, so there has to be some form of programmed goodness in there too.
